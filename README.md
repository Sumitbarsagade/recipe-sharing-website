Project Setup
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Sumitbarsagade/recipe-sharing-website.git
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
cd recipe-sharing-website
npm install
3. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following keys:

bash

```# MongoDB Connection String
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/recipeAppDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Cloudinary Configurations
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# JWT Secret for Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```


üå©Ô∏è Cloudinary Setup
To allow users to upload images to Cloudinary, follow these steps:

Cloudinary Configuration in Backend (db.js):
```javascript

import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary';

// Cloudinary configuration
cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});```

export default cloudinary;
```

Image Upload Route (recipeController.js):

```javascript
exports.createRecipe = async (req, res) => {
  const { title, description, ingredients, procedureSteps, recipeType, cuisineType, image } = req.body;

  try {
    // Upload image to Cloudinary
    const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(image, {
      upload_preset: 'recipe_images',
    });

    // Save the recipe with Cloudinary URL
    const newRecipe = new Recipe({
      title,
      description,
      ingredients,
      procedureSteps,
      recipeType,
      cuisineType,
      imageUrl: result.secure_url,  // Store Cloudinary URL
      userId: req.user._id,
    });

    await newRecipe.save();
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Recipe created successfully' });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating recipe', error });
  }
};
```

üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB Setup
Create a free MongoDB cluster using MongoDB Atlas.
Connect to your cluster and get the connection URI.
Replace <username>, <password>, and <dbname> in the .env file with your own credentials and database name.
Example:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://myUser:myPassword@cluster0.mongodb.net/recipeAppDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
Mongoose Recipe Model (Recipe.js):
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const recipeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true },
  ingredients: [String],
  procedureSteps: [String],
  recipeType: { type: String, required: true },
  cuisineType: { type: String, required: true },
  imageUrl: { type: String },  // Cloudinary URL
  userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.model('Recipe', recipeSchema);
```
